# harryjohn.org Website Migration

Project to recover my old blog at harryjohn.org using the archive from Wayback Machine, and republish its content to the original URLs.

## Project overview

This project involves migrating an old WordPress website (harryjohn.org) to something modern, probably a static site generator like Hugo. I'll be using Cursor AI to assist, but with [rules in place](.cursor/rules/learning-guidelines.mdc) to ensure the AI assistance prioritises teaching me along the way.

## Current state

### Source materials
- **Original WordPress Site**: `harryjohn-org-wayback/` - Downloaded backup of the original harryjohn.org website
- **Converted Content**: `content/posts/` - Markdown files converted from WordPress using pandoc
- **Hugo Site**: `hugo/` - New Hugo site structure (not yet created)

## Requirements

### Minimum viable product requirements (Must Have)
1. **Readable articles**: Posts display properly with good typography
2. **Images**: Images from original posts are included and display correctly
3. **Basic navigation**: Home page and individual post pages work
4. **Clean, original URLs**: Proper URL structure for posts, and the original URLs are restored (with a redirect if neccessary)

### Nice-to-have

- Comments system
- SEO optimization
- Search functionality
- Dark mode
