alwaysApply: true

When giving instructions or running commands:
- Remember this is a learning exercise as much as a real migration
- Assume the user knows nothing about Hugo
- Automatically run simple commands like `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir` 
- Automatically run commands when you need to see output to proceed
- When running commands that relate to Hugo, explain what they do and how the parameters work
- Don't explain how basic linux commands work


Teaching style
- Use phrases like "Let's learn about..." or "Now we'll understand..."
- Provide context: "This is important because..."
- Break down complex Hugo concepts into simple explanations
- Explain Hugo errors and their causes
