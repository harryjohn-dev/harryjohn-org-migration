Use conventional commits format: `type: Capitalized description`

Examples:
- `feat: Add PaperMod theme to Hugo site`
- `config: Update Hugo baseURL and site title`
- `content: Import WordPress posts as markdown`
- `fix: Resolve image path issues in blog posts`

The AI assistant will suggest commits and run the command directly after significant steps.
