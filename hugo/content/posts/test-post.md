# Test Post

This is a test post to verify that our Hugo site is working correctly.

## What we're testing

- **Post creation**: Can we create new posts?
- **Front matter**: Are the metadata fields working?
- **Markdown rendering**: Does the content display properly?
- **Theme integration**: Is the PaperMod theme working?

## Next steps

Once we confirm this post displays correctly, we'll:
1. Import the converted WordPress content
2. Fix any formatting issues
3. Update image paths
4. Deploy to harryjohn.dev

This is just a test to make sure everything is working before we start the real migration!
