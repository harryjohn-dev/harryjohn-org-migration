In here you will find subscriptions to:\n\n-- Visio Pro for Office 365\n-- Project Pro for Office 365\n\nOf course, purchasing a subscription license for these products\nallows you access to the latest 2016 versions which will install\nalong-side the Office 2016 suite.\n\nI know this isn't the answer your looking for and whether you\nwill ever be able to install Visio/Project Pro 2013 alongside\nOffice 2016 is currently unknown to me -- if I find out I'll\nsend you another reply.\n\nHarry"
