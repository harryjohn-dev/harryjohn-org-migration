		<description><![CDATA[Hi Zack &#038; Douglas,

Apologies for not updating this article, at the time of writing parts 1 and 2 we were using PowerConnect 5548 switches - the reason for the change to a set of PowerConnect 7048 switches is due to a recommendation from Dell that the 5548 switches are no longer approved for iSCSI use with EqualLogic Arrays.

I wanted to install these new switches and ensure my configuration is sound in a live environment before writing part 3. I can now confirm that this upgrade has proved highly beneficial in that we are seeing no longer seeing any iSCSI disconnects and the TCP retransmit rate has improved significantly (now almost non-existent).

I will publish part 3 shortly and will include the pros/cons of LAG vs stack as promised!
