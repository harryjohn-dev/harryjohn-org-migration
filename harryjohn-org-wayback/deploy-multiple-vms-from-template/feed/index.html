		<description><![CDATA[Hi, 
Thanks for sharing the script! I am having trouble with the job calling the deployvm script, it does not seem to have the machinename or datastore at that point. Can you explain the following?
- when you set the job up, where are you getting all of those arguments?
- when the job is started, more parameters are sent - haven&#039;t they already been set up when you set up the job?
-  the deployvm script seems to be waiting for different named parameters

Sorry it&#039;s just that I am not experienced enough in PS to understand all of this, though I have tried. Does the script run for you? 

Thanks!]]></description>
