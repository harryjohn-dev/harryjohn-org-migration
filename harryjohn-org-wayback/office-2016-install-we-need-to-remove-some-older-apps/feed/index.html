		<description><![CDATA[We have just updated our PC with Office2016 and when we are using Office 365 business essentials. Now, when we try to sync sharepoint on PC it says you have One Drive for Business 2013, and can&#039;t sync.

But One Drive For Business works fine if I uninstalled Office2016. So, is there a way to make One Drive for Business working with Office2016?

Looking for some help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Similar issue where I have Office 365 and standalone Access 2013 and can&#039;t upgrade Office.

After hours hopping between MS departments and being on hold I finally used the Billing and Accounts chat service. Sent link to error message that talks of free upgrades and got upgrade form Access 2013 to 2016. 

Now problem is a catch 22 in neither product will upgrade with removing the other? Has anyone had any success upgrading to 2016 products?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not everyone is clear about whether they are using 365 Click to Run or MSI installers.  I also notice that many people are referring to Office ProPlus having these types of issues, but no one says Office Professional Plus (which is volume licensed).

I read this problem plagues Office 365, but not so much the Office Volume License\MSI version.

Can anyone clarify if they have problems when strictly using MSI installers?

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[DISASTER!  I have just installed Project Professional 2016 on my laptop and also received the &#039;remove older apps&#039; message.  I continued only to discover these older app were actually the WHOLE of Office 2013.  All applications deleted - word, excel, PowerPoint, outlook.  The only things that has survived is Visio (odd considering the experiences others have reported).  I am now more than a little distraught as I&#039;ve now lost all my access to mail and will now need to get hold of a copy of either Office 2016 or delete project and try and find my old copy of office with install codes.  I think MS are now on par with iTunes as the worst offenders in the industry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I had microsoft office 2013 installed on my computer, but I needed visio 2016 for a school project. After downloading it, it removed all of my old office programs (word, powerpoint, excel, access) . Windows Recovery didn&#039;t work in undoing it. I thought it was telling me it had to close apps, not uninstall. They look almost identical. When I called them they said I&#039;ll just have to buy office 2016 now. 

FUCK microsoft. This is a fucking mob tactic. You steal something, then make me pay to get it back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have the opposite issue. i downloaded Visio 2016 Professional and all of my Office 2013 products were removed. No icons, programs list, etc... Tried running the office2015.exe and I get an error that a newer office 2016 product is installed on my computer and it will not load. Not happy after spending $600 for Visio 2016 Pro. Do I upgrade to Office 2016 now as the only fix to keep Visio 2015 Pro? Running WIndows 7 Pro on 2015 Dell. Thx!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

I also installed Office 2016, only to see that Project Pro 2013 was gone. OTOH, Visio Pro 2013 remained intact. 
I tried to re-install Project Pro 2013 after Office 2016 and - strangely enough - it worked.
I now have everything in place (please note 32-bit versions).
Can anyone else confirm ?]]></description>
