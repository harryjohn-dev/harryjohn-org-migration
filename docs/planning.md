## Phase 0: Planning

1. Define requirements for hosting
    - Minimal maintenance, fully managed, no security patching required
    - Low cost or free
    - Low friction to add posts to the blog
    - "Blog as code" and linked to version control
    - Preferably hosted by either Cloudflare or Github (as I already have accounts with them)

2. Compare options 
    - Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, Wordpress
    - Decided on Hugo - works well with Cloudflare & Github
